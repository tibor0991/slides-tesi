# What is this?
This is a public repo of the slides that will be shown during my undergraduate thesis presentation. It also works as a usage example for **markdeep** and the `markdeep-slides` template.

# Why?
Since I worked on this thesis both in the uni and during commutes on my laptop, I'd rather use a tool that relies as little as possible on mouse input.
Also:

* Neatly integrated with Chrome;
* Comes with a timer and presenter notes;
* Don't have to rely on PowerPoint/GSlides;
* Why not?
